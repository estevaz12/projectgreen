PRoject Green

PRoject Green is a website with the purpose of communicating the environmental
problems that the island of Puerto Rico faces. These range from deforestation,
to climate change, to energy crises, and environmental justice. This website
will serve as an educational experience on the different environmental issues on
the island and as a call to action towards sustainable practices and environmental
protection. The environment and sustainability is a topic that I'm personally
interested in because we are currently in the midst of a climate crisis. As an
information systems major and an Environmental and Sustainability Studies minor,
this would be a great way to combine technology and the environment and educate
others.

PS: The "PR" in "PRoject" stands for Puerto Rico. Its read "Puerto Rico Project
Green" :)


Rationale for colors:

Because the theme is the environment I chose a color scheme that would represent
the three different biospheres that I address in the website (land, water, air).
I did this by following an analogous color scheme with three colors as the base.
Green for land, blue for water, and yellow for air.
